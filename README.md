# GRAPS
Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is a powerful metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization, working in iterative cycles of building a solution (Construction Phase) and then refining it (Local Search Phase) to find near-optimal answers for complex problems like routing or scheduling.
